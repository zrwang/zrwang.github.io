<blockquote class="full-width"><p>Roboticist, Entrepreneur, and Enthusiast</p></blockquote>

I am the Co-Founder & CTO of Cornerstone Robotics Limited. Before this, I was a Research Assistant Professor in the [Department of Mechanical and Automation Engineering](http://www.mae.cuhk.edu.hk/){:target="_blank"} (MAE) and the [CUHK T Stone Robotics Institute](http://www.cuhk.edu.hk/ri){:target="_blank"} at [The Chinese University of Hong Kong](http://www.cuhk.edu.hk/){:target="_blank"} (CUHK).

I earned my Ph.D. from CUHK's MAE department with support from the prestigious [Hong Kong PhD Fellowship](https://cerg1.ugc.edu.hk/hkpfs/index.html){:target="_blank"}. My advisor was [Prof. Yun-hui Liu](http://www.mae.cuhk.edu.hk/people/list.php?name=yhliu){:target="_blank"}. In the final two years of my doctoral studies, I was fortunate to work as a visiting student at [Johns Hopkins University](http://www.jhu.edu/){:target="_blank"} in the [Laboratory for Computational Sensing + Robotics](http://lcsr.jhu.edu/){:target="_blank"}. There, I collaborated with [Prof. Peter Kazanzides](http://smarts.lcsr.jhu.edu/people/peter-kazanzides/){:target="_blank"} and [Prof. Russell H. Taylor](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~rht/){:target="_blank"}. Prior to my Ph.D., I received my B.E. degree from [Beihang University](http://www.buaa.edu.cn/){:target="_blank"} in China.
